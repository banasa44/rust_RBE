# Rust Exercises ðŸ¦€

In this repository I will be doing the Rust exercises from the [official web page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) to practice and improve my Rust skills.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: The entry point of the project. Handles user input to select and run specific exercises.
- `src/exercises`: Contains different modules, each hosting multiple exercises.

## How to Run

To run the project, navigate to the root directory and use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Adding New Exercises

1. Add a new function in the respective module (src/exercises).
2. Update main.rs to include the new exercise in the selection prompt.

## Requirements

Rust needs to be installed.
